## Fix for Issue 2: Enable Leaked Password Protection

To enable leaked password protection in Supabase:

1. Log in to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to your project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/locviruzkdfnhusfquuc
3. Navigate to Authentication > Settings
4. Find the "Passwords" or "Security" section
5. Enable the option for "Leaked Password Protection" or similar
6. Save your changes

This setting prevents users from using passwords that have been compromised in known data breaches by checking against HaveIBeenPwned.org.
